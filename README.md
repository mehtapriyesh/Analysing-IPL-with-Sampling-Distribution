Hello everyone, this is one of my biggest analysis. I have tried covering a lot of concepts which are useful from cricket's point of view. 

Analysis conducted using R and dataset from Kaggle IPL Dataset by Manas Garg (https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)
For furher analysis, I've created my own scores dataset. I could've used the deliveries dataset to get scores per team, but this was just for brushing my web extraction skills.

You'll find final code on Kaggle Notebook linked above with all the interpretations. 
(There maybe some minor differences in the files here and those on the notebook.)

Being a Statistics student, I am always excited about applying theoretical knowledge I acquire from my university at a real world level.
Feel free to drop in an email at mehtapriyesh7401@gmail.com if you are unable to understand reasoning behind certain steps I've used in the program.
